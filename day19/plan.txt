Create function to read in input file into lists of workflows and ratings
Create function to take workflows list and create dictonary
	letters before { are the key
	separate fields by , to get the rules
	rules must be processed in order
	check first character of rule
		if first character in 'x', 'm', 'a', 's' then represents the category and it is a conditional
		if it is a conditional then second character is the comparison (< or >)
		the number after < or > is the value (convert to int)
		look up the value of the category in the current workflow dictionary to do the comparison
		the value after the : is the next step
	if there is no conditional then the entire field is the next step
Create a function to process the ratings
	initialize total to zero
	for each line in the list
		remove first and last characters
		split line by ,
		split resulting fields by =
		the first value will be the key ('x', 'm', 'a', 's')
		the second value will be the value (convert to int)
	call function to determine if parts are accepted
	if accepted
		iterate through dictionary values and all to total value
Create function to determine acceptance
	receive workflows and rating
	initialize result to result of workflow 'in' on rating, workflow(workflows, rating, 'in')
	while result not in 'A', 'R'
		result = workflow(workflows, rating, result)
	return result
Create function process a workflow on a rating
	workflow = workflows[rating]
	for rule in workflow:
		if len(rule) == 1
			return rule[0]
		else
			category, conditional, value, next_step = rule[0], rule[1], rule[2], rule[3]
			if conditional == '<':
				if rating[category] < value
					return next_step
			elif conditional == '>':
				if rating[category] > value
					return next_step
