1. Read input file into list
2. Modify list by creating row with all dots at top and bottom
3. Further modify list by adding a dot as the first and last character of each row
4. Initialize sum to zero
5. Process each line:
    when a digit is found a number is started
    store [row,col] in adjacency check list
    while next character is a digit
        multiply number by 10 and add next digit
        store [row,col] in adjacency check list
    after end of number
        for each [row,col] in adjacency check list
            if symbol adjacent then add to sum
6. Return sum


Symbol adjacent function
1. if [row-1,col-1] is not a dot or a number return true
2. if [row-1,col] is not a dot or a number return true
3. if [row-1,col+1] is not a dot or a number return true
4. if [row,col-1] is not a dot or a number return true
5. if [row,col+1] is not a dot or a number return true
6. if [row+1,col-1] is not a dot or a number return true
7. if [row+1,col] is not a dot or a number return true
8. if [row+1,col+1] is not a dot or a number return true
9. return false
