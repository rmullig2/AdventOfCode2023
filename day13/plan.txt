Main function
-------------
Call function to read input into list of lists of strings
Call function on each list of strings to get its score
Print sum of scores

Read input function
-------------------
Read input file into lines
Initialize patterns as empty set
Initialize pattern as empty set
Iterate line over lines
	if line append to pattern
	else append pattern to patterns and set pattern to empty set
Append last pattern to patterns

Get horizontal score
--------------------
Iterate from 0 to length of rows-1
If row == row+1 return row+1
Return None if you reach the end

Get vertical score
------------------
Convert lines into list of lists
Use np.transpose(list of lists) to get transposed list of lists
Create new string list
	initialize an empty list
	Iterate over transposed list
	add new string with ''.join(list)
Call Get horizontal score on new string list and return value

Get total
---------
Initialize total to 0
Iterate over each pattern
	total += (horizontal score * 100)
        total += vertical score
Print total
